They see me mowin'
My front lawn
I know they're all thinking
I'm so white 'n' nerdy

Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Can't you see I'm white 'n' nerdy?
Look at me I'm white 'n' nerdy

I wanna roll with
The gangsters
But so far they all think
I'm too white 'n' nerdy

Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Really, really white 'n' nerdy

First in my class here at M.I.T.
Got skills, I'm a champion at DND
MC Escher, that's my favorite MC
Keep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea
My rims never spin to the contrary
You'll find that they're quite stationary
All of my action figures are cherry
Stephen Hawking's in my library

My Myspace page is all totally pimped out
I got people begging for my top 8 spaces
Yo, I know Pi out to a thousand places
Ain't got no grills but I still wear braces

I order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise
I'm a whiz at Minesweeper, I can play for days
Once you see my sweet moves you're gonna stay amazed
My fingers movin' so fast I'll set the place ablaze

There's no killer rap I haven't run
At Pascal well I'm number 1
Do Vector calculus just for fun
I ain't got a gat but I got a soldering gun (what?)

Happy Days is my favorite theme song
I can sure kick your butt in a game of ping pong
I'll ace any trivia quiz you bring on
I'm fluent in Java Script as well as Klingon

They see me roll on, my Segway
I know in my heart they think I'm
White 'n' nerdy

Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Can't you see I'm white 'n' nerdy?
Look at me I'm white 'n' nerdy

I'd like to roll with
The gangsters
Although it's apparent I'm too
White n' nerdy

Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
How'd I get so white 'n' nerdy?

I've been browsing, inspectin'
X-Men comics you know I collect 'em
The pens in my pocket, I must protect 'em
My ergonomic keyboard never leaves me board
Shopping online for deals on some writable media
I edit Wikipedia
I memorized the Holy Grail really well
I can recite it right now have you ROTFLOL

I got a business doing websites
When my friends need some code who do they call?
I do HTML for them all
Even make a homepage for my dog

Yo, I got myself a fanny pack
They were having a sale down at the GAP
Spend my nights with a roll of bubble wrap
Pop pop!
Hope no one sees me get freaky!

I'm nerdy in the extreme
And whiter than sour cream
I was in AV club and Glee club
And even the chess team!

Only question I ever thought was hard
Was do I like Kirk or do I like Picard?
I spend every weekend at the Renaissance Faire
I got my name on my underwear!

They see me strollin'
They laughin'
And rollin' their eyes 'cause
I'm so white 'n' nerdy

Just because I'm white 'n' nerdy
Just because I'm white 'n' nerdy
All because I'm white 'n' nerdy
Holy cow I'm white 'n' nerdy!

I wanna bowl with
The gangsters
But oh well it's obvious I'm
White 'n' nerdy

Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Think I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
I'm just too white 'n' nerdy
Look at me I'm white 'n' nerdy!
